# 2. Collect the user's favorite music genre.

# 3. Collect the user's favorite genre rating, 0-100.
# (No need to validate, but be sure to enter a valid integer.)



# 4. Ask the user if they enjoy other genres.
# The variable should be a boolean.
# You can either convert the `input` function string to a bool(input("prompt"))
# using the boolean literal "True" or "False"
# or compare strings: yes/no, y/n, etc.

# 5. Move all `input` operations to the top of the file.
# Collect the four questions.
# Print at the end.
